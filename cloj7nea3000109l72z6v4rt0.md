As programmers we are bound to make mistakes and experience bugs, bugs are what make programming more interesting. Sometimes our scripts have errors, These errors could be a result of our mistakes, wrong user input, server runtime errors, etc. `Try...catch` only works for runtime errors

For `try...catch` to work, the code must be runnable. In other words, it should be valid JavaScript.

**i. What is try...catch block?**

A try...catch block is used to handle errors in our javascript. we use it when we don't want an error in the script to break our code while the code is running. it has two main blocks: the try block and the catch block.

try block: The **try** statement allows us to check whether a specific block of code contains an error or not

catch block: The **catch** statement allows us to display the error if any are found in the try block.

Below is the snippet representation of a try...catch block.

The code works in this order:

1. First, the code in `try {...}` is executed.
    
2. If there were no errors, then `catch (err)` is ignored: the execution reaches the end of the `try` and go on, skipping `catch`.
    
3. If an error occurs, then the `try` execution is stopped, and control flows to the beginning of the `catch (err)`. The `err` variable (we can use any name for it) will contain an error object with details about what happened.
    
4. we can move forward to introduce the throw
    

Example: In the example below, we will see the usage of try...catch block in JavaScript.
